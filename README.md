## Note for Linux Devices

"Send to Trash" functionality on Linux-based devices only works with
the `trash-cli` dependency.
Unfortunately, I was unable to find a Java library with Recycle Bin
functionality that supported Linux, so I had to rely on this package.
The dependency should be installable from your distribution's package manager,
or at the following GitHub page: https://github.com/andreafrancia/trash-cli
